### <a name="creative-researcher"></a> Job Opening: Creative Researcher

**Date:** January 10, 2017

Are you a data-focused creative committed to ethical practice? Are you convinced that there are better ways to work with and visualize data? Are you interested in driving conservation, making tools for activism and data literacy, promoting open science, and bringing data into public space? Are you in NYC, or willing to relocate to NYC?

The Office for Creative Research is hiring one talented (and multi-talented!) individual to work at our new studio in Brooklyn on a wide range of data-focused projects. We build user-focused tools, public space interventions and forward-looking prototypes in the service of understanding and humanizing complex data systems. Currently, we're developing a one-click open platform for field researchers and explorers, empowering individuals to reverse engineer ad targeting, creating a space for St. Louis residents to examine the lived geographies of their city, instrumenting a glacier, installing a data sculpture celebrating immigration in the world's busiest public space, and examining the reach of one of the world's largest social networks.

We are a hybrid research group, working at the intersection of technology, culture and education, and so are very interested in multidisciplinary candidates.


Maybe you’re a backend developer who’s obsessed with the intricacies of algorithmic decisions. Or perhaps you are artist with a keen UX and communications sensibility and a penchant for unconventional research. In general, we are interested in applicants with rich practices that expand over multiple fields.

Culturally, we are a relaxed and focused environment. All team members are self-directed, and opportunities exist for project leadership.

Applicants should have proven experience prototyping, designing, developing and releasing data-focused projects on a deadline. We are looking for people who have 3+ years of real-world experience. We use Processing, OpenFrameworks, Python, MongoDB, Node.js, Three.js, Golang, React.js, Sketch, Grasshopper, library cards, pencils, paper, modeling clay, robots and coloured markers, but applicants are encouraged to bring their own toolsets and approaches.

We take diversity seriously, so applications are particularly welcome from women, PoC, and other groups under-represented in tech.

The Office for Creative Research is dedicated to a transparent, open working environment. All OCR staff earn a flat salary – currently $90,000/year – as well as an annual bonus. We have a 401k program, and support medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time employees.

Interested applicants can send a cover letter and a resume to [jobs@ocr.nyc](mailto:jobs@ocr.nyc)
