Making scientific concepts accessible through interactivity and animation. Trying to build models to predict the next viral outbreaks. And using the poop emoji wherever we can.

Simon J. Anthony, an epidemiologist at the Columbia University Mailman School for Public Health, who studies viral diversity in animals, asked us to build an interactive experience to illustrate findings from his recent <a href="

Anthony led a team of researchers in Bangladesh as they collected samples of viruses from different groups of semi-urban dwelling macaques. The viruses they studied were found in the macaques' poo.

An animated voiceover outlines key concepts from the paper, like pattern finding and different types of deterministic relationships. An interactive game builds upon the ideas outlined in the voiceover, where players identify certain types of patterns and relationships between viruses present in a group of macaques.
