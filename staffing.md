### <a name="creative-researcher"></a> Immediate Opening: Freelance Creative Researcher w/ Robotics Experience 

**Date:** Feb 7, 2017

The Office for Creative research is looking for a multi-talented developer to come work with us to build a community mapping platform. If you're into robotics, mapping, and community activism, read on!
In collaboration with the Center for Creative Research, OCR is building the [St. Louis Maproom](http://www.cocastl.org/event/st-louis-map-room/), a community space for exploring and creating original, interpretive maps of the city that reflect the personal stories and lived experiences of its residents. As part of that experience, robots will be drawing outline maps of participant-selected parts of St. Louis.
We're looking for someone to help us build those mapping robots. 
Give us a shout if you have experience with:
- Robotics, especially wheeled robots
- OpenCV, especially positioning systems
- Bonus: drawing machines or map-making tools

- The timeline is short (the space opens on March 3rd!), so let us know if you're available in the very near future and are interested in helping out. The position is paid, and may continue after the opening of the exhibition. 

Please send a resume and cover letter to [jobs@ocr.nyc](mailto:jobs@ocr.nyc)
