Acumen approached OCR with the task of highlighting one of their newest social ventures, Ziqitza Health Care Limited, which provides ambulance services to rural parts of India. The data they wanted to visualize tracked an entire incident, from the emergency call, the ambulance pickup, and determining the severity of the injury and whether it could be treated on site or the patient needed a transfer to a larger hospital. The data is from a month of operations in the state of Odisha, in the eastern part of India in February 2014.

We made an interactive map that animates the ambulance activity over time. 27,288 routes across the state. Main arteries are visible - reflects on what the transit infrastructure is, allows you to see where services are required. If you compare that with a map you could identify good locations for potential infrastructure improvements.

Looked at duration of the calls and distances that the ambulances need to travel - other ways to potentially improve infrastructure. visualizes time of dispatch, route ambulance took, disappears once it reaches destination.

Sort by base location, day of the week, hour, ambulance to take the trip, type of emergency or complaint. Sorting allows you to see where there are more people living, more need, fewer roads. What the majority of illnesses in particular regions are, and using that to plan health services that would be best for the communities.
