A live data expedition into the Okavango Delta. Visit the website <a href="http://intotheokavango" target="_blank">here</a>.
Expedition led by Steve Boyes of <a href="http://www.wildbirdtrust.com/" target="_blank">The Wild Bird Trust</a>.

Into the Okavango displays data which was uploaded daily, via satellite, by the expedition team in the Okavango Delta. Data is also available through a public API, allowing anyone to re-mix, analyze, or visualize the collected information. The software allows viewers to virtually experience one of the last remaining areas of true wilderness, normally inaccessible to the average person.

National Geographic explorer Dr. Steve Boyes has been leading expeditions into African wilderness for the past ten years. A South African ornithologist, Boyes dedicates his work to the conservation of the largest remaining untouched delta on our planet. For the past three expeditions, The Office for Creative Research provided Boyes and his team with live tracking software that visualized their GPS position, wildlife sightings, and position-based commentary. Jer Thorp joined the 2014 and 2015 expeditions into the Delta, adding another layer of real-time data analysis.
