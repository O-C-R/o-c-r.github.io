Making scientific concepts accessible through interactivity and animation. Trying to build models to predict the next viral outbreaks. And using the poop emoji wherever we can.

OCR was approached by Simon J. Anthony, an epidemiologist at the Columbia University Mailman School for Public Health, who studies viral diversity in animals, to build an interactive experience to illustrate findings from his recent research [link to paper]. Anthony led a team of researchers in Bangladesh to collect samples of viruses from different groups of semi-urban dwelling macaques. They did this by collecting money poo and analyzing it.

An animated voiceover outlines key concepts from the paper, like pattern finding and different types of deterministic relationships. An interactive game builds upon the ideas outlined in the voiceover, where players identify certain types of patterns and relationships between viruses present in a group of macaques. Visit <a href="http://www.letspredictviruses.com/" target="_blank">letspredictviruses.com</a> to experience the interactive game and narrative.
