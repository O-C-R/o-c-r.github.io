2015 marked the 100-year anniversary of the General Theory of Relativity, which Albert Einstein proposed after publishing the Field Equations of Gravitation in November 1915. Scientific American approached OCR to create a visualization that demonstrates the impact of the general theory. After researching available data, OCR decided to create a visualization that takes a snapshot of scientific research a century after the general theory was proposed, to show which areas of scientific research derived from the general theory are most active a hundred years later.

OCR created a three-dimensional landscape of scientific papers tagged with the general relativity - quantum cosmology category on arXiv.org, a database which contains scientific papers that have been published or are under peer review. Using a list of about sixty keywords of subjects that relate to general relativity, we analyzed papers.
