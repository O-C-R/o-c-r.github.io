The room would be good enough for the time she had to stay is a dynamic data portrait of the modern hotel. The project imagines the narratives of well-known characters from famous pieces of literature if they had stayed in the various hotels.  By inserting a human layer, the data narrative attempts to understand the hotel as a lived experience.

Commissioned by the <a href="https://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/" target="_blank">Vancouver Art Gallery</a> for the <a href="http://projects.vanartgallery.bc.ca/publications/Hotel/exhibition-page/" target="_blank">Grand Hotel exhibition</a>, an exhibition that explores the evolution of the hotel from a utilitarian structure to a cultural institution.
