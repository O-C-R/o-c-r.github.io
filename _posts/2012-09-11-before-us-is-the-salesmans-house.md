Before Us is the Salesman's House is a site-specific artwork, installed at the eBay headquarters in San Jose, which investigates this idea of the eBay database as a cultural artifact. Working in cooperation with eBay, Inc., and the <a href="http://www.zero1biennial.org/" target="_blank">ZERO1 Biennial</a>, the piece was installed outside of the eBay headquarters and ran dusk to midnight from September 11th to October 12th.
