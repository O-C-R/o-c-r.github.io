<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> is a public agency. This means that while they’re not hurtling objects into space, measuring the earth in novel ways, developing clever technologies, or freeze-drying foods, they’re filing reports. Lots of reports. For example, every year since 1958, NASA has released ‘<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/timeline.html" target="_blank">Astronautics & Aeronautics Chronologies</a>’, which outline the agency’s aerospace activities in science, technology and policy. For the July issue of <a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/science/whole-brilliant-enterprise-nasa%E2%80%99s-first-50-years-one-interactive-graphic" target="_blank">Popular Science</a>, OCR made a 4-page, 3,460-word visualization which tells the story of NASA’s history in the agency’s own words.

Popular Science also enlisted OCR to describe our <a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/science/behind-scenes-%E2%80%9C-whole-brilliant-enterprise%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">process for creating the graphic</a>, which involved parsing the chronologies, cross-referencing events with articles on the New York Times, and building a custom Natural Language Processing pipeline to determine important people and places.

The Whole Brilliant Enterprise was built using Processing. Text analysis was hugely assisted by Daniel Howe’s excellent <a href="http://rednoise.org/rita/" target="_blank">RiTa toolkit</a>.
