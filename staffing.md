We are a hybrid research group, working at the intersection of technology, culture and education. We build user-focused tools, public space interventions and forward-looking prototypes in the service of understanding and humanizing complex data systems.

Currently, we're developing a one-click open platform for field researchers and explorers, empowering individuals to reverse engineer ad targeting, creating a space for St. Louis residents to examine the lived geographies of their city, instrumenting a glacier, working on our annual publication, and examining the reach of one of the world's largest social networks. We are a small team with wide ranging backgrounds, we don’t do advertising, we’re committed to ethical practice, we work on fascinating projects, and we’re hiring!

**Open Positions:**

* [Creative Researcher](#creative-researcher)
* [Full-time (Temp) Operations Manager / Community Director](#temp-ops-manager)

### <a name="creative-researcher"></a> Job Opening: Creative Researcher

**Date:** October 19, 2016

Are you a design-focused creative committed to ethical practice? Are you convinced that there is a better way forward with data? Are you interested in driving conservation, making tools for activism, promoting open science, and bringing data into public space? Are you in NYC, or willing to re-locate to NYC?

The Office for Creative Research is hiring one talented (and multi-talented!) designer to work at our new studio in Brooklyn on a wide range of data-focused projects. We are very interested in the multidisciplinary – ideally you are a visual designer, fluent in UX who often expresses your work in front-end code as well as flat comps. Or maybe you are a visual designer with a keen writing and communications sensibility. Culturally, we are a relaxed and focused environment. All team members are self-directed and opportunities exist for project leadership.

Applicants should have proven experience designing, developing and deploying data-focused projects. We are looking for people who have 3+ years of real-world experience. We use Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, Python, MongoDB, node.js, THREE.js, Sketch, Grasshopper, library cards, pencils, paper, modeling clay and coloured markers, but applicants are encouraged to bring their own toolsets and approaches.

We take diversity seriously, so applications are particularly welcome from women, PoC, and other groups under-represented in tech.

The Office for Creative Research is dedicated to a transparent, open working environment. All OCR staff earn a flat salary – currently $85,000/year – as well as an annual bonus. We support medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time employees.

Interested applicants can send a cover letter and a resume to [jobs@ocr.nyc](mailto:jobs@ocr.nyc)
