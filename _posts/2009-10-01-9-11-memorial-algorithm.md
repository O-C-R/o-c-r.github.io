Working with Jake Barton and <a href="http://localprojects.net/" target="_blank">Local Projects</a>, Jer Thorp designed an algorithm and an accompanying software tool to aid in the placement of the nearly 3,000 names on the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan. Built in Processing, these computational tools allowed the designers of the memorial to satisfy the nearly 1,500 ‘meaningful adjacency’ requests made by family members of 9/11 victims.
