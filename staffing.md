**We currently have no open positions.** Please check back for future openings.

We are a hybrid research group, working at the intersection of technology, culture and education. We build user-focused tools, public space interventions and forward-looking prototypes in the service of understanding and humanizing complex data systems.

Currently, we're developing a one-click open platform for field researchers and explorers, empowering individuals to reverse engineer ad targeting, creating a space for St. Louis residents to examine the lived geographies of their city, instrumenting a glacier, working on our annual publication, and examining the reach of one of the world's largest social networks. We are a small team with wide ranging backgrounds, we don’t do advertising, we’re committed to ethical practice, and we work on fascinating projects.
