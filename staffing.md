### Jobs




**Title:** Job Opening – Developers, Designers, Creative Researchers

**Date:** February 8, 2016

Are you a data scientist, developer or designer committed to ethical practice? Are you convinced that there is a better way forward with data? Are you interested in driving conservation, making tools for activism, promoting open science, and bringing data into public space? Are you in NYC, or willing to re-locate to NYC?

The Office for Creative Research is hiring talented (and multi-talented!) designers, developers and data scientists to work at our new studio in Brooklyn on a wide range of data-focused projects. We have a soft spot for the multidisciplinary – perhaps you are a visual designer, fluent in UX who can secretly write front-end code. Or maybe you are a full-stack developer with a keen visual sensibility. Culturally, we are a relaxed and focused environment. All team members are self-directed and opportunities exist for project leadership.

We are a hybrid research group, working at the intersection of technology, culture and education. We build user-focused tools, public space interventions and forward-looking prototypes in the service of understanding and humanizing complex data systems.

Currently, we’re helping to protect elephant populations in Africa, creating a space for St. Louis residents to examine the lived geographies of their city, engaging citizen scientists to connect joint pain with weather conditions, and examining the reach of one of the world's largest social networks.

Applicants should have proven experience designing, developing and deploying data-focused projects. We are looking for people who have 3+ years of real-world experience. We use Processing, OpenFrameworks, Python, MongoDB, node.js, three.js, Sketch, Grasshopper, library cards, pencils, paper, modeling clay and coloured markers, but applicants are encouraged to bring their own toolsets and approaches.

We take diversity seriously, so applications are particularly welcome from women, PoC, and other groups under-represented in tech.

The Office for Creative Research is dedicated to a transparent, open working environment. All OCR staff earn a flat salary – currently $85,000/year – as well as an annual bonus. We support medical, dental, and vision coverage for all full-time employees.

Interested applicants can send a cover letter and a resume to [jobs@ocr.nyc](mailto:jobs@ocr.nyc)
