The world around us is deeply networked. People and ideas from across the globe are constantly intersecting, thanks to media, technology, and travel. The realities of this are at once exciting and daunting. Information can be shared freely with relatively few barriers, opening up broader possibilities for discovery and invention. But problems no longer exist in isolation, and solving them requires a deep understanding of how everything connects.
                    
Yet as this kind of cross-disciplinary thinking becomes more critical, our education system struggles to change with the times. Despite the introduction of digital tools and devices into the classroom, how curriculum is structured remains relatively unchanged since the pre-Internet era. Knowledge is categorized into a series of separate disciplines – math, science, literature, history – with little focus on how they all fit together or overlap.
                    
Microsoft, a builder of networks and a provider of education technology, is passionate about bringing schools into the 21st century. To brainstorm how best to achieve this, they partnered with the Office for Creative Research (OCR), a multidisciplinary research group, and TrueSchool, a startup dedicated to redesigning the education experience. Together, they came up with an idea and a digital prototype that aims to better connect the world inside the classroom to the world outside. The result is Project Spool.
