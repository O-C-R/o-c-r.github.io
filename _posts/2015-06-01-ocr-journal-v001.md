In June of 2015, The Office for Creative Research published a limited edition run of their first annual print publication. The Journal contains essays, visualizations, artwork and poetry, made around the central theme of “Data as a verb.” All written and visual material was produced by OCR staff, collaborators, and past OCR Friday speakers. The Journal is intended to be a window into OCR’s process, as well as a platform for experimentation that allows for more whimsical applications of the work we do. Each of the full-color covers in the 500 edition run was unique, generated from different datasets.
